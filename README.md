Project Objective : To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor
                    and analyze credit card operations effectively.

Steps I followed to make this Credit Card dashboard project :
1. Collected the CSV files and uploaded them into power BI desktop.
2. Prepared the data after data cleaning,data processing and created new columns for filtering using DAX queries.
3. Created the visual reports with the data and saved the .pbix file in local system.
